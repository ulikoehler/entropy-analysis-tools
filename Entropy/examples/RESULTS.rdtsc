rdtsc is an example to test whether sequential Time Stamp Counter reading in (nearly) equal intervals produces random results or a linear function graph (over a ring modulo 2^64)
The workflow is as follows:

make
./rdtsc
cp rdtsc.txt ../scripts/
cd ../scripts
./enumerate.py rdtsc.txt stats.dat
cp stats.dat ../r-scripts/
cd ../r-scripts
./r.sh 2d-graph.png.R

The graph is written to 2d-graph.png.
The result is nearly an exact (stepped) linear graph (over a ring modulo 2^64)
