Entropy analysis tools is a tool suite for analyzing data in binary or numeric form.
The project consist of the following subprojects:
-Entropy: Fast analyzator for binary and numeric files; contains R scripts for displaying the data.
-NumBinConverter: Converts numeric files to binary (and reverse).
-RandGen; Fast random number generator using Boost::Random (TR1 canditate). Supports multiple generators and distributions.
		There are also some runtime-configurable generator scripts in the scripts directory.
-TextAnalyzer: Tool for statistical cryptographic text analysis. Contains a python script for text pattern scoring (To be extended).
-EasyBotan: Provides a high level C++ cryptography interface using Botan and a command line tool using it. Also provides functions suitable for testing the other tools

Compile using NetBeans or directly using the Makefile.
Compilation may take very long (caused by the very high optimizing level).
If you just want to test, make the target "Fast". This may result in a slow executable.
All applications are optimized for 64-bit targets.

If you don't use a Core2 processor or anything compatible, change the Makefile directive
"-march=core2" to the best architecture directive for your processor.

You may disable some features by supplying preprocessor definitions on make command line.
